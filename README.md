# python-postgres-playground
Python scripts and projects to practice connecting, querying, and managing PostgreSQL databases. Hands-on playground for learning database programming with Python.

This repository is a hands-on playground for practicing PostgreSQL database programming using Python. 

Here you'll find example scripts and projects covering:

- Connecting to PostgreSQL from Python with `psycopg2`
- Creating, reading, updating, and deleting (CRUD) database records
- Executing parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Managing transactions and handling errors
- Basic database schema design and table creation
- Optional: Introduction to SQLAlchemy ORM for Python developers

Whether you're new to databases or want to sharpen your skills integrating PostgreSQL with Python, this repo offers practical code samples and exercises to boost your confidence and competence.

## Getting Started

1. Install PostgreSQL and create a test database and user.
2. Set up a Python virtual environment and install dependencies (`psycopg2-binary`).
3. Run and modify the example scripts to understand how Python interacts with PostgreSQL.
